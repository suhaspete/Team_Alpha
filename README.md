# Problem Statement - 03
   Design an intelligent traffic signal optimization algorithm that uses machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust signal timings based on traffic flow patterns, congestion levels, and time of day, with the goal of reducing wait times and improving overall traffic flow.

# Project Description
   TrafficGuru is a smart traffic management solution designed to optimize traffic signal timings using advanced machine learning algorithms. The system dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time traffic flow, congestion levels, and time of day, aiming to reduce vehicle wait times, minimize congestion, and enhance overall traffic efficiency. By leveraging data analytics and adaptive learning, TrafficGuru can make intelligent decisions to improve the movement of vehicles through intersections, leading to smoother traffic flow and reduced emissions.

   This project utilizes the SUMO-RL framework, which integrates the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) with reinforcement learning techniques, providing a robust environment for training and testing adaptive traffic signal control strategies. The use of SUMO-RL enhances the system's ability to simulate realistic traffic scenarios and enables continuous learning from dynamic traffic patterns.
